        <p class="body-text">
          Oftentimes, websites for local businesses are not created by
          designers. The website for my family's restaurant, Hunan Garden, falls
          into this category. I decided to redesign Hunan Garden's website, not
          just because it could use some touch-ups with regards to usability and
          accessibility, but also because it's exciting to have the chance to
          give back in some way to my parents and this restaurant that raised
          me.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          The contents of the current website are a little scattered around the
          page, there are duplicate buttons for ordering online, and the site is
          not optimized for mobile screens. From talking to my parents, I
          learned they also wanted a more modern looking site to attract
          customers.

          I then created a style guide (with reds and yellows inspired by the
          fire theme of the original), which informed the high-fidelity
          wireframes and the development of the site with HTML and CSS.

        <p class="body-text">
          Even after coding the design, I feel a little conflicted about whether
          this is the "best" website design for the restaurant. I wish I was
          able to convey the cozy, welcoming environment of the restaurant
          through the design. How can we design websites with intention in order
          to convey a specific feeling or to capture the essence of what the
          website is for? Something I am still mulling over.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          Through this project, I gained a greater understanding of the design
          process for a responsive website. It can be very time consuming!!
          Figuring out the low fidelity wireframes and high fidelity mockups
          definitely led to a smoother time coding. Responsivity and
          accessibility are big things to consider when developing any website.
