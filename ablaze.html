        <h1 class="subheader-text colored-text">---the problem---</h1>
        <p class="body-text">
          With the pandemic, the United States saw a surge in anti-Asian
          sentiment and the lockdownâ€™s disproportionate effect on Asian-American
          Pacific Islander (AAPI) owned businesses. Now, a few years later, AAPI
          individuals and businesses are still feeling the financial and
          emotional impacts.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          Working with a team of three other students, we wanted to support our
          AAPI community and bring attention to the many talented business
          owners and creators out there. In addition to being a site for users
          to find local AAPI businesses, we want our web app to be a resource
          and platform where business owners and creators can share their work.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          For this first prototype, we focused on the Boston area due to the
          data available and used mock data where needed.
        </p>

      <section class="project-content">
        <h1 class="subheader-text colored-text">---user stories---</h1>
        <p class="body-text">
          Based off of interviews we conducted with artists, creators, business
          owners, and consumers, we created a set of user stories to guide our
          implementation and to ensure our design would actually be useful to
          users.

        <ul class="body-text">
          <li>
            <span class="colored-text">A Musician:</span>
            <br />
            As a musician hoping to break out into mainstream music, I want to
            easily promote myself on a platform where others can hear my music
            on various streaming platforms such as Apple Music or Spotify. I
            also want people to connect with me through my social media profiles
            and business email.

          <li>
            <span class="colored-text">An Author:</span>
            <br />
            As an aspiring author, I want to easily share my words with others
            who resonate with my AAPI experience or would like to learn more
            about my history. I want to be able to connect with readers and make
            sure they have access to my website and social media.

          <li>
            <span class="colored-text">A Family-Owned Chinese Restaurant:</span>
            <br />
            As a small business owner, I want to promote my business. I am
            worried about not being able to understand the platform and would
            like instructions on how I can gain more traction. I want to be able
            to showcase the menu we have and photos of the delicious food we
            offer.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="colored-text">A College Student:</span>
            <br />
            As an Asian-American college student in Boston, I want to search for
            Asian-owned businesses in my area. I miss food from home, and it
            would be comforting to be able to find and filter places for Asian
            restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, and other types of
            businesses.

        <h1 class="subheader-text colored-text">---implementation---</h1>
        <p class="body-text">
          As one of two front-end developers on this project, I handled the
          pages for AAPI creators and artists. For this prototype, I created a
          page where users could search and filter for AAPI musicians, connected
          to the Spotify API.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">

          alt="spotify page"
          src="./assets/ablaze/spotify.png"
        />
        <p class="body-text">
          I also created a separate page where users can search for additional
          types of artists and creators, which is intended to be a place for
          creators to submit themselves to be displayed on the site. I mocked
          the data for this version of the web app.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">process shot of page with creators displayed:</p>
        <img

      <section class="project-content">
        <h1 class="subheader-text colored-text">---takeaways---</h1>
        <p class="body-text">
          This was my first time working with a team to develop a web app, and I
          learned how important it is to communicate. I learned to communicate
          effectively with backend developers in order to successfully integrate
          all of the parts of the project. I also got a lot of practice mocking
          data for the cases where I was unable to connect to the backend.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          In addition, I learned to start early! Some features didn't work out
          as intended, and we modified our design as we went. Starting early
          gave us the room to adapt to challenges.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          It was also my first time working extensively with React and HTML/CSS,
          and I really enjoyed it!
