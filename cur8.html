        <p class="body-text">
          CUR8 is a startup that curates custom carbon removal portfolios
          according to customers' needs and goals. Currently, the process of
          generating a portfolio is done manually, and clients must consult with
          representatives from CUR8 for several months before making a purchase.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          The company is hoping to streamline the purchasing process and has
          started designing a portfolio simulation tool. They asked us to
          continue on their design to create a purchasing flow so that users can
          buy the portfolios that they have generated.

        <p class="body-text">
          We each designed two potential solutions to generate a wide variety of
          layout ideas. While we did these independently, we realized that many
          aspects of our flows overlapped, which helped us decide what would be
          most intuitive for our first iteration of wireframes.

          We then used these sketches to create our low-fidelity prototypes,
          which consisted of pages for a typical purchasing flow, like a review
          and confirmation page. We made additional considerations for buying a
          carbon removal portfolio, like including a page for users to request
          feedback from stakeholders.

          <li>Giving users more details on specific carbon removal projects</li>

            feedback

          After revising our low-fidelity wireframes, we used CUR8's style guide
          to create high-fidelity prototypes. We got another round of feedback
          from the CUR8 team, and our final prototype is below.

          Our prototype starts on step 5 to build on CUR8's existing portfolio
          simulator, which ends on step 4. Click through to see how a user would
          go through the purchasing flow, from learning about the types of
          projects, inviting stakeholders, and reviewing their portfolio before
          making a purchase request.

      <section class="project-content">
        <h1 class="subheader-text colored-text">---takeaways---</h1>
        <p class="body-text">
          A purchasing flow is something we're all familiar with and seems
          rather straightforward, but we learned that there are actually very
          important considerations to make depending on the purpose of the
          product. Carbon removal portfolios are a complex product and must be
          thoughtfully considered before buying, so we had to design a flow with
          enough friction and information so that users are satisfied with what
          they are purchasing. We really enjoyed this project and learned a lot
          about the iterative design process!
