          CUR8 is a startup that curates custom carbon removal portfolios
          according to customers' needs and goals. Currently, the process of
          generating a portfolio is done manually, and clients must consult with
          representatives from CUR8 for several months before making a purchase.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          The company is hoping to streamline the purchasing process and has
          started designing a portfolio simulation tool. They asked us to
          continue on their design to create a purchasing flow so that users can
          buy the portfolios that they have generated.

          We each designed two potential solutions to generate a wide variety of
          layout ideas. While we did these independently, we realized that many
          aspects of our flows overlapped, which helped us decide what would be
          most intuitive for our first iteration of wireframes.
